# This is a section header

This is a template for an R Markdown document that you can Knit to a Word document. It will produce a document that is consistent with the basic elements of the Grattan Institute style. Note that the [redoc package](https://noamross.github.io/redoc/index.html) is required to generate Word documents that can be re-converted to R Markdown. If you don't have redoc, and don't want to install it for some reason, amend the output listed in the YAML header above from `redoc::redoc:` to `word_document:`.

You can add footnotes.[^1]

If you have a bib file, you can add citations.

You can use things like inline <!--- an HTML comment ---> comments.

Chunks with plots
-----------------

You can also embed plots, for example:

#### This is a plot title
##### This is a plot subtitle
```{r plot, dev.args=list(bg='transparent'), echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
library(ggplot2)
library(grattantheme)

  ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_grattan()

```
###### This is a plot caption

Some text goes here.

### This is a heading with Heading 3 styling 

More text goes here

## This is a second-level heading

Lorem grattsum

This is a heading with the underline style
------------------------------------------

Track Changes
-------------

**redoc** supports [Critic Markup](http://criticmarkup.com/users-guide.php)
syntax for comments. You can include edits and they will be converted to tracked
changes in your {==  Word document  ==}{>> Neat! <<}. By default , your system
username is used as the author of changes, but this can be set with the
`comment_author` argument in `redoc()` or your document YAML.
