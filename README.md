Create ggplot2 charts in the Grattan Institute style

Use theme_grattan() to format your ggplot2 charts in a style consistent with the Grattan style guide, including elements such as gridline colours and width, font size, etc.

Use grattan_pal() to format the coloured elements of your ggplot2 chart using appropriately-spaced Grattan colours, ordered from either light to dark or the reverse.

Use grattan_save() to save your ggplot2 charts (eg. as .png or .pdf files) for use elsewhere, such as in Powerpoint or LaTeX, with the size and resolution set to style guide-consistent values.

A range of colours from the style guide (such as grattan_lightorange, grattan_red, and so on) are defined for your convenience.
